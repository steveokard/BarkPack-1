# Contributing

This project is made just for fun. But any support, spelling, bug fixes, or new features are welcomed. I'm as prepared as I'll ever be to take any and would love to discuss what you have to offer. Below is a illustration of which type of changes you choose to make should go. In the future, we may have a beta branch but baby steps. ^^
