# Bark Pack Characters

This is a brief infobox-ready information for Bark Pack.

Keep in mind, other people's characters/fursonas can't apart of the in-universe group. This is simply to avoid any possible real life conflicts. Better safe than sorry.

## Anthony Wilcox

- Species: Fennec
- Height: 5'1"
  - Ideally, Finnick's (Zootopia) size
- Occupation: Journalist
- Sex: CB
- Eye color: blue on right, green on left
- Affiliated: Bark Pack, KETO-TV

### Notes

While not crucial, I feel his sex/gender needs to be properly addressed without feeling forced. Slice-of-life often relies on the environment to do the story telling. I've often looked to politics as a way addressing the matter but I feel like that's become way too easy and clich√© when I feel like there is another way.

## Zack Casey

- Speices: Blue Fox
- Height: 5'6"
- Occupation: TBA
- Sex: Male
- Eye color: Blue
- Affiliated: Bark Pack

### Notes

Zack took a career as a DJ in the original web comics in 2005. These had no name until Z's Shorty Manga explicitly had one. However, they're all considered of the same era up until 2010.

His career has ben scaled back in Bark Pack to him creating mixes on his computer. The reason behind this is because the DJ career kinda hit the backburner since Z's Shorty Manga and later incarnations.

## Kit Welsh

- Speices: Raccoon
- Height: 5'4"
- Occupation: TBA
- Sex: CB
- Eye color: Green
- Affiliated: Bark Pack

### Notes

Kit Welsh needs to be properly explored. In earlier incarnations: he is loner with high threshold for friendships, and is much more masculine, despite the similar sex to Anthony. He was given rich parents in the pre-Sixam Bark Pack which I'm thinking of keeping as a justification for his anti-social behavior.
