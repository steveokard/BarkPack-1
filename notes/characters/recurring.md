### Notes

Saveli Cornell is the third incarnation of Dr. Puppy. He is a much more toned down version than previous incarnations. He likes to tinker around with robots just as a hobby. This was inspired by My Ordinary Life's Hakase and the CU era. Although toned down, his short fuse, and hates being called "puppy," just like the Deviant era. He doesn't pursue of power or chaos like before but he does get ahead of himself and is chaotic in nature.

## Rolan Yamamoto

- Species: Android
- Affiliated: Saveli Cornell (owner)

### Notes

Rolan Yamamoto is inspired by My Ordinary Life's Nano Shinonome, although without the useless upgrades. Rolan serves a similar role to Nano and his CU era incarnation in that it does chores around the house but also has a mind of it's own. In terms of upgrades, it takes after The Sims 3: Into the Future's Plumbots and their trait chips.
