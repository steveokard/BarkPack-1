# Amtrak's Mountain Peaks

Mountain Peaks is an active Amtrak train that stops at Fairview. The train serves California, Chicago and Washington, DC, with Fairview being an intermediate stop.

## Artistic license

In real life, long distance trains in America head to and from Chicago and Washington, DC, or to and from Chicago and California. The Mountain Peaks trains make travels to New York from Washington, DC, more viable within the narrative while still keeping the state's location rather vague. As a consequence this makes the overall route twice as long as the average real life Amtrak train. To make up for this the train gets a fresh pair of locomotives during it's stop at Chicago.

This is more of a mental note to myself since I pretty much have the inner workings of Amtrak memorized. And I'm pretty certain the Mountain Peaks train would never be able to do this in real life for a variety of reasons.
