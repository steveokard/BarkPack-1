# DDR mini-game

The DDR mini-game (or DDR mode) is a possible future mini-game based on the scene in which Anthony asks if Zack wants to play DDR. Unlike the scene in the novel, the mini-game would offer the ability for the player to choose from a series of moves that would go towards building a character's skill.

The chance of success (CoS) will be based around the character's skill and his interest in that song's genre, however they'll be 10% chance of failure even if both are maxed. I'm not really good at my division but it would look something like this: ``(Interest / Skill) - 10``.

This may be separate game that would likely use another engine, due to complexity and scope. But it would give me a excuse to try out another engine I've been itching to put to good use.
