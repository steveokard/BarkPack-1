# Former eras

In order to understand Bark Pack's origins you first got to know about the past. It's complicated because of the amount of trial and error it took to get here. These eras provide a shortend for explaining the relation of past and present incarnation of characters. They mostly fall under a certain timeline or in-universe setting.

## Deviant era

The Deviant era is the first era. It's when I came up with a range of comedic web comics from slice-of-life or shout outs to real life that were published on DeviantART. It was originally dubbed The Furry Blue DJ era, due to Zack's initial career as a DJ, and included only a small subset of comics. This has been retroactively changed because that never amounted to anything within the comics themselves and would later evolved into Z's Shorty Mnaga.


## Casey Universe era

Casey Universe (CU) was meant to be a more serious sequel with slightly more adult themes in contrast to the Deviant era. As the name implied, it was meant to expand on the universe created by the former era by wrapping loose ends of the former while starting a fresh. 

CU was based on the idea of an epic. It took the main characters around the world in search of resources to defeat the bad guy, Saveli Cornell (Dr. Puppy), that had taken over the city, Furville. It was meant to be split into multiple series of short ebooks that dwelled into every aspect of what was _that_ universe. Started with introduction of the characters; war for Furville; Saveli's reign and main character's travel across the world; and the second war for Furville. The project was canceled because I couldn't fill in the middle part enough to align with what the ending would be.

It was saw the return of Zack Casey, of course, as this was meant to wrap up loose ties, but also introduced Aidan Cheddar, a house mouse that would change his life. Saveli Cornell - I don't remember the name I gave him in CU but it wasn't Saveli - began as more of a joke on villains, focusing on their short temper. He hated being called short. Dr. Puppy was the antagonist in Casey Universe that was capable of building robots but was obsessed with power and took over Furville.

Dr. Puppy's character developed with the conflicts he had with a sentient robot during his rain of power over the city. The robot was meant to be companion because he was actually quite alone, but, if I remember correctly, the robot eventually turned on him to help the heroes. The robot itself is also from the Deviant era but his role wasn't very clear since it was made for the hell of it, at the time.
